> x <- c(5, 3.2, 7, 9) = assigns a function to a variable
> sample (ex$height,1) = takes 1 random sample from height column in ex database, can take any number instead of 1
> x <- 0:10 = creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10 with 1 unit interval
> seq (0,10,length=1000) - produces 1000 segments in the 0-10 region
> x <- rep(v,t) = creates a sequence (x) of repeated values (v) s specific number of times (t)
> for (i in 1:100) { x[i] <- y } = for loop that assigns 100 y values to each cell in x sequence
> mean(x$column, na.rm=TRUE) = ignores N/A values
> mean(ex2$group == "HIGH") = computes the proportion/relative frequency of HIGH values in the GROUP column in ex2 database 

> ls() = outputs a list of all objects saved so far
> rm(x) = removes the object x
> rm(list=ls()) = removes all objects at once
> x = matrix(data=c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) = creates a matrix. data, nrow, ncol can be omited 
  , byrow=TRUE) - fills the matrix by r
> A[1,3] = selects the element from row 1 column 3 in A matrix 
> A[,2:4] = selects all elements from all rows and 2 to 4 columns
> A[-1,3] = keeps all rows except 1
> cor(x,y) = computes correlation between x and y sets
> set.seed(123) = when applied every time before rnorm() it reproduces the exact same set of random numbers.
> attach(x) = after plot(x$columnName,...) removes the need to use $ when mentioning the columnName


VIZ
> data.frame (table(x)) = creates a table view of x data frame
> plot (table(x)) = creates a bar-plot
> plot (x,y,xlab="this is the x-axis", ylab="this is the y-axis", main="Plot of X vs Y")
> plot (x,den, type="l") = creates a plot on the x interval and den segment and connects the dots with lines
> hist (x$height, col=2, breaks=15) = creates a histogram for x data frame for "height" column, col=2 is the same as col="red", break is the nr of bins the hist will be divided in 
> pairs (x) = creates scatterplot matrix for every pair in the x dataset 
> pairs (~ col1+col2+col3+col4+col5 , x) = pairs for specific columns 
> identify (y-axis, x-axis) = inserted after plot function allows selecting manualy elements on the plot, after exit it identifies the values for all selected elements
> boxplot (x$height) = creates a boxplot
> pdf ("file name.pdf") = creates a pdf file in the main directory. Can be jpeg or other fomats.
> dev.off() = after pdf and plot saves the plot to pdf
> contour(x,y,z) = creates a contour plot
> image (x,y,z) = creates a heatmap
> persp (x,y,f ,theta =20, phi =30) = draws a 3D plot and moves it 20 degree horizontaly to right and 30 degree vertically up


READ/EDIT/EXPORT
> ex <- read.csv("ex1.csv") = opens ex1.csv from the main directory
> read.table ("fileName.data", header = T, na.strings ="?") = reads a data file, makes first rows as headers, interprets ? as N/A
> names(x) = prints column titles 
> dim(A) = outputs the nr of rows and columns of matrix A 
> fix(file) = opens another window view of the file 
> x=na.omit(x) = removes rows with N/A
> column = as.factor(column) = converts quanTitative varaible into quaLitative
> write.table() = exports into data file



SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION

// probability (mean of abs) of the sample average (X.bar) falling within 1 unit (<=1) of the population mean
> mean (abs(X.bar - mean(pop.1$height)) <= 1)

// Simulation: expectation of the sampling distribution for the sample average of the variable
> X.bar <- rep (0, 10^5) // future sequence/statistic with 0 values to be replaced
> for (i in 1:10^5) {  //same size as X.bar
+     X.samp <- sample(pop.2$bmi,150)  //extracts random samples from population or creates them with r...() formulas
+     X.bar[i] <- mean(X.samp)  //a statistic formula (T=X_bar/S/sqrt(n) for example) executed on the random sample and assigned to a cell
+ }
> mean(X.bar) - is the E(Xbar)
> sd(X.bar)

// central region that contains 80%
> quantile(X.bar, c(0.1, 0.9)), where X.bar can be any T statistic formula calculated in the simulation

// normal approximation of the central region that contains 80% of the sampling distribution of the sample average 
> qnorm(c(0.1,0.9), E(Xbar), sd(Xbar))
// the 90th percentile for the average score
> qnorm(0.9, E(Xbar), sd(Xbar))
// The 90th percentile for the total score for the XX observations
> XX*qnorm(0.9, E(Xbar), sd(Xbar))
// The probability that the total of the XX observations is less than 200 (for example)
> pnorm (200/XX, E(X), sd(X))

//structure of the central region of 90% of the normal distribution
> E(X) +/- qnorm(0.95) * sd(Xbar) => c = qnorm(0.95)*sd(Xbar)	

/// CLT
> E(Xbar) = E(X) - the expectation of the sample mean is equal to the theoretical expectation of its components 
> Var(Xbar) = Var(X)/n - the variance of the sample average, n is size of the sample 
> sd(Xbar) = sqrt(Var(Xbar)) = sd(X)/sqrt(n)
> Z = (Xbar - E(Xbar)) / sqrt(Var(Xbar)) = (sqrt(n)(Xbar - E(X))) / sqrt(Var(X)) - the standardized sample average
