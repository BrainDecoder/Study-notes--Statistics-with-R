GENERAL/BASIC
> x <- c(5, 3.2, 7, 9) = assigns a function to a variable
> sample (ex$height,1) = takes 1 random sample from height column in ex database, can take any number instead of 1
> x <- 0:10 = creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 10 with 1 unit interval
> seq (0,10,length=1000) - produces 1000 segments in the 0-10 region
> x <- rep(v,t) = creates a sequence (x) of repeated values (v) s specific number of times (t)
> for (i in 1:100) { x[i] <- y } = for loop that assigns 100 y values to each cell in x sequence
> mean(x$column, na.rm=TRUE) = ignores N/A values
> mean(ex2$group == "HIGH") = computes the proportion/relative frequency of HIGH values in the GROUP column in ex2 database 

> ls() = outputs a list of all objects saved so far
> rm(x) = removes the object x
> rm(list=ls()) = removes all objects at once
> x = matrix(data=c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2) = creates a matrix. data, nrow, ncol can be omited 
  , byrow=TRUE) - fills the matrix by r
> A[1,3] = selects the element from row 1 column 3 in A matrix 
> A[,2:4] = selects all elements from all rows and 2 to 4 columns
> A[-1,3] = keeps all rows except 1
> cor(x,y) = computes correlation between x and y sets
> set.seed(123) = when applied every time before rnorm() it reproduces the exact same set of random numbers.
> attach(x) = after plot(x$columnName,...) removes the need to use $ when mentioning the columnName


VIZ
> data.frame (table(x)) = creates a table view of x data frame
> plot (table(x)) = creates a bar-plot
> plot (x,y,xlab="this is the x-axis", ylab="this is the y-axis", main="Plot of X vs Y")
> plot (x,den, type="l") = creates a plot on the x interval and den segment and connects the dots with lines
> hist (x$height, col=2, breaks=15) = creates a histogram for x data frame for "height" column, col=2 is the same as col="red", break is the nr of bins the hist will be divided in 
> pairs (x) = creates scatterplot matrix for every pair in the x dataset 
> pairs (~ col1+col2+col3+col4+col5 , x) = pairs for specific columns 
> identify (y-axis, x-axis) = inserted after plot function allows selecting manualy elements on the plot, after exit it identifies the values for all selected elements
> boxplot (x$height) = creates a boxplot
> pdf ("file name.pdf") = creates a pdf file in the main directory. Can be jpeg or other fomats.
> dev.off() = after pdf and plot saves the plot to pdf
> contour(x,y,z) = creates a contour plot
> image (x,y,z) = creates a heatmap
> persp (x,y,f ,theta =20, phi =30) = draws a 3D plot and moves it 20 degree horizontaly to right and 30 degree vertically up


READ/EDIT/EXPORT
> ex <- read.csv("ex1.csv") = opens ex1.csv from the main directory
> read.table ("fileName.data", header = T, na.strings ="?") = reads a data file, makes first rows as headers, interprets ? as N/A
> names(x) = prints column titles 
> dim(A) = outputs the nr of rows and columns of matrix A 
> fix(file) = opens another window view of the file 
> x=na.omit(x) = removes rows with N/A
> column = as.factor(column) = converts quanTitative varaible into quaLitative
> write.table() = exports into data file
