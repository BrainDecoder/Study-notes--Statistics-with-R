DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
> table (x) = counts the frequency of values
> round (x$columnname,0) = rounds the values in columnname to integer, should be assigned to another table 
> sum (x) = sums the values
> cumsum (x) = calculates cumulative sum of values
> mean (x) = calculates the average
> median (x) = calculates the median
> length (x) = counts the elements in X 
> abs (x-5) = computes the absolute number for each element in X range minus 5
> summary (x) = calculates min, max, 1st and 3rd Quartiles, median, mean/average
> sort (x) = sorts the list by increasing values; sort(x,TRUE) by decreasing 

> cumulative relative frequencies = cumsum (x/sum(x))
> deviation for each element = x - mean (x)
> variance = sum ((x-mean(x))^2)/(length(x)-1)
> standard deviation = sqrt (sum ((x-mean(x))^2)/(length(x)-1)) or sqrt (variance)


PROBABILITY / RANDOM VARIABLES
> P(X) or probability to get randomly a subject with a specific characteristic = total count of subjects with the specific characteristic / total population
> mean (abs(X-170) <= 10) = the probability to get a value between 160 and 180 in the X range
> Var(X) or variance of a random variable = sum((x-E(X))^2 * P(x))	
> sd (X) or standard deviation of a random variable = sqrt (Var(X))
> var (x) = calc. the variance 
> sd (x) = calc. the standard deviation 

> X~Binomial(n,p) = binomial random variable distribution, where n is number of repeats/trials/pax and p is probability of success in each trial (ex. 1/2 for coin, 1/6 for die side) or % of pax to fit a category
> E(X) = n*p is expectation of Binomial random variable 
> Var(X) = n*p*(1-p) is variance of the Binomial random variable 
> dbinom (c(x1, x2, ...), n, p) = calc. the probability of various possible values of Binomial random variable 
> pbinom (c(x1, x2, ...), n, p) = calc. the cumulative probability of Binomial
> qbinom 
> rbinom (sample size, n, p) = produces a random sample from the Binomial distribution

> X~Poisson(lambda) = means random variable X has a Poisson distribution with expectation E(X)=lambda
> E(X)=Var(X)=lambda=n*p
> dpois (c(x1, x2, ...), E(X)) = computes probability according to Poisson distribution 
> ppois (c(x1, x2, ...), E(X)) = computes the cumulative probability according to Poisson distribution 
> qpois
> rpois (n, lambda)

> E(X) = (integration) SS(x*f(x))d*x - expectation of a Continuous random variable 
> Var(X) = SS((x-E(X))^2*f(x)d*x - variance of a Continuous random variable 

> E(X) = (a+b)/2 - expectation of a Uniform random variable 
> Var(X) = ((b-a)^2)/12 - variance of a Uniform random variable 
> dunif (0:10 or 4.56, 3, 7) = density function at given values (uniform random variable), 3,7 is the interval
> punif (4.89,3,7) = comp. cumulative probability of the uniform distribution (everything to the left of 4.89) = is equal with (4.89-3)/(7-3)
> qunif (%, min, max)

> E(X) = sd(X) = 1/lambda - expectation of Exponential distribution
> Var(X) = 1/lambda^2 - variance of Exponential distribution
> dexp () - computes the density of Exponential distribution
> pexp (point, rate) - cumulative probability of Exponential distribution
> qexp
> rexp (sample size, lambda) = produces a random sample from the Exponential distribution

> dnorm (point, E(X), sd(X))- computes the density of Normal distribution
> pnorm (point, E(X), sd(X)) - cumulative probability of Normal distribution at a specific point 	
> qnorm (%percentile, E(X), sd(X)) - computes Normal distribution percentile
> rnorm (n, mu, sig), where n is the sample size, mu is the expected mean of the sample, sig is the expected sd of the sample 
> z-score = (original value - E(X))/sd(X)
> for Normal approximation W/O continuity of Binomial use E(X) and sd(X) from Binomial in the Normal formulas
> for Normal approximation with continuity add 0.5 to the point/points
